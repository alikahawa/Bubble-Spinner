| The game shall have a hexagonal grid on which the bubbles are located. | Implement data structure to store bubbles and display bubbles on screen | Marije, Jordy | 4                         | 1        |
| The game shall have a bubble at the center that can not be removed by playing, it will have a special color(i.e. gray). | The game shall have a bubble at the center that can not be removed by playing, it will have a special color(i.e. gray). | Rosalie       | .5                        | 1        |
| The player shall be able to shoot a bubble from the cannon by pressing the left mouse button or space. | Assign cannon firing to user input                           | Ali, Toma     | .5                        | 1        |
| The player shall be able to change the direction of the cannon by moving the mouse. | Make the cannon rotate and change direction of projectile using the mouse coordinates. | Ali, Toma     | 1                         | 1        |
| The game shall randomly generate the color of a bubble to be shot. | Implement a bubble randomizer for the cannon                 | Ali, Toma     | .5                        | 2        |
| The player shall win the round, when only the center bubble is left. | Implement a check for bubbles remaining and reset the level. | Jordy         | .5                        | 2        |
| The game shall reflect bubbles when they hit walls.          | Implement wall collision and bubble reflection               | Toma          | 1.5                       | 2        |
| The game shall make the shot bubble stick to the first other bubble it hits. | Implement bubble collision                                   | Marije        | 3                         | 1        |
| The game shall place sticking bubble in the nearest available grid position from the collision point. | Determine closest available grid point, and append bubble to the grid. | Marije        | 1                         | 1        |
| The game shall remove bubbles from the screen when they have the same color and their connected sum is >= 3. | Check if enough colored bubbles are connected, remove bubbles from grid if so | Jordy, Toma   | 2                         | 2        |
| The game shall remove all bubbles that have become disconnected from the center. | Implement Algorithm to detect if bubbes are still connected to the center. | Jordy, Toma   | 2                         | 2        |
| The game shall be over when a bubble on the grid touches a wall. | Implement a detection for when a bubble on the grid touches a wall, and then end the game. | Rosalie       | 3                         | 2        |
| The game shall have a random selection of bubbles at the middle of the grid around the centre bubble when it starts. | Implement an algorithm that psuedo randomizes the bubbles at the start of the game. | Rosalie       | 3                         | 1        |
